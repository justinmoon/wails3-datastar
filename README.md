Integrates wails3 and datastar. My [my wails2 demo](https://github.com/justinmoon/wails2-datastar) devines a custom plugin and IPC-based SDK code to do everything. This one runs a gin server which is piped directly through wails mechanics [as suggested by docs](https://v3alpha.wails.io/guides/gin-services/). So there is much less custom stuff going on here which I think should be better in general.
